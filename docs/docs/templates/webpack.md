This template provides a basic project setup using Webpack.

## Features

- **Webpack**: A static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications.
- **`webpack-dev-server`**: Provides a live-reloading development server.

## Files Included

- `src/index.js`: The main JavaScript entry point.
- `webpack.config.js`: The Webpack configuration file.
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that loads the bundled JavaScript.
- `.gitignore`: Configured to ignore `node_modules`, `dist`, and other common files.
- `package.json`: Configured with `start` and `build` scripts, and necessary dependencies.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start`: Starts the development server with live reloading.
- `npm run build`: Builds the application for production to the `dist` folder.

## Getting Started

1.  **Install Dependencies**: After creating your project, install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Run Development Server**: Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (or another port if 8080 is in use) to view your application.
