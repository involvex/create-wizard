## Features

-   **Vite**: A fast build tool that provides a lightning-fast development experience.

## Files Included

-   `index.html`: The main HTML file for your application.
-   `src/main.js`: The main JavaScript entry point.
-   `.gitignore`: Configured to ignore `node_modules`, `dist`, and other common files.
-   `package.json`: Configured with `dev`, `build`, and `preview` scripts, and necessary dependencies.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

-   `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
-   `npm run build`: Builds the application for production to the `dist` folder.
-   `npm run preview`: Serves the production build locally.

## Getting Started

1.  **Install Dependencies**: After creating your project, install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Run Development Server**: Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or another port if 5173 is in use) to view your application.
