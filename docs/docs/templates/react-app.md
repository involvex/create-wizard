This template provides a basic React application setup using Vite.

## Features

-   **React**: The JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   **Vite**: A fast build tool that provides a lightning-fast development experience.

## Files Included

-   `index.html`: The main HTML file for your application.
-   `src/App.jsx`: The root React component of your application.
-   `src/index.jsx`: The entry point for your React application, rendering the `App` component.
-   `.gitignore`: Configured to ignore `node_modules`, `dist`, and other common files.
-   `package.json`: Configured with `dev`, `build`, and `preview` scripts, and necessary dependencies.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

-   `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
-   `npm run build`: Builds the application for production to the `dist` folder.
-   `npm run preview`: Serves the production build locally.

## Getting Started

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
