## [3.7.0](https://github.com/involvex/create-wizard/compare/v3.3.0...v3.7.0) (2025-09-20)

### Features

- **cli:** Overhauled the CLI with a modern, animated UI using `@clack/prompts`.
- **cli:** Added a `-v` or `--version` flag to display the current version.
- **cli:** The project name can now be provided as a command-line argument to skip the prompt.

### Bug Fixes

- **npm:** Ensured `README.md` and `LICENSE` are included in the published npm package.
- **tests:** Updated the entire test suite to mock `@clack/prompts`, fixing all timeout errors.

### Chore

- **release:** The release script is now handled by the developer locally, and the CI/CD pipeline is solely responsible for publishing to npm, preventing duplicate releases.
- **release:** Added comprehensive safety checks to the release script to ensure a clean working directory, the correct branch, and synchronization with the remote repository.
- **templates:** Refactored the PowerToys plugin templates to be more modular by giving each its own Visual Studio Solution file.
- **templates:** Removed unnecessary `obj` and `bin` folders from the PowerToys plugin templates.
